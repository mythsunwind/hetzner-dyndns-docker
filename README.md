hetzner-dyndns-docker
=====================

Dockerfile and Ansible playbooks to update DNS entry on Hetzner grapped from Fritzbox.

The docker container executes the playbook every 5 minutes.

⚠️ **This code does use the new Hetzner Cloud API** ⚠️

It does not work anymore if you have not migrate your DNS entries to Hetzner Console. Keep in mind that
you have to generate a new API token in Hetzner Console after migrating the DNS entries.

Playbooks based on previous work from P. Haberkern (thedatabaseme) with the following adjustments:
* Fritzbox UPNP interface does not need username/password
* Don't update the record if the IP has not changed
* Set TTL for DNS entry to 60 seconds instead of 24 hours
